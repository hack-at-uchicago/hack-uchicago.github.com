    <p><b>Hack Nights</b> are a time set aside each week for coders and anyone generally interested in technology to gather and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_%28programmer_subculture%29" title="Hacking">hack</a> together. We meet up every Friday evening from 4:30-8:00 PM in <a href="http://maps.uchicago.edu/mainquad/ryerson.html" title="Ryerson">Ryerson 255</a> (the big lounge), and we usually end up ordering pizza for everyone around 5 or 6, but we also serve light refreshments on occasion.</p>

    <p>Hackers and attendees are free to work on projects or homework assignments, mingle with fellow students, and even just hang out. Beginners and experts, and everyone in between, are welcome to join in&#8212;there will actually be a couple of experienced students in the room specifically to help beginners learn more about coding and provide pointers on how to get started on projects.</p>
